## 📱 Screens

### Screen 1 — Pace Selector
> Set your fastest 100m freestyle time with an interactive custom UI

- **Pace input (MIN : SEC)** — large numeric displays with up/down arrows + tap-to-edit direct input
- **Validation** — seconds clamped to `0–59`, total range `0:45` – `4:00`
- **Custom slider** — piecewise linear mapping with glowing active sector, tick labels at `1:10`, `1:30`, `2:00`
- **Swimmer level** — dynamically computed and displayed with animated color transitions
- **Continue button** — sends `POST` to `/posts` with `{ "pace_seconds": N }`, debounced ~500ms, with loading spinner and error handling
- **Skip option** — swipes to Screen 2

### Screen 2 — User Directory
> Fetch and browse users from a public REST API

- **User list** — fetched from `GET /users` with typed models
- **Search** — instant filter by name
- **Pull-to-refresh** — re-fetches data from API
- **User detail** — tapping a user navigates to a full profile with contact, address (with geo coordinates), and company details
- **Error handling** — clean, user-friendly error messages for network/server failures

## 🏊 Swimmer Level Ranges

| Level | Pace Range | Seconds |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🥇 **Elite** | `0:45` – `1:09` | 45s – 69s |
| 🥈 **Advanced** | `1:10` – `1:29` | 70s – 89s |
| 🥉 **Intermediate** | `1:30` – `1:59` | 90s – 119s |
| 🏅 **Beginner** | `2:00` – `4:00` | 120s – 240s |

## 🧠 State Management — Why BLoC?

I chose **BLoC** (`flutter_bloc`) for the following reasons:

1. **Consistency** — both screens use the same state management approach, making the codebase unified and predictable
2. **Separation of concerns** — events (`FetchUsers`, `SearchUsers`, `SubmitPace`) map linearly to state transitions, keeping logic fully separated from the UI
3. **Efficient search** — keeping both `users` (full list) and `filteredUsers` (search subset) in a single state avoids redundant API calls during local filtering

Feature-first **Clean Architecture** with three layers per feature:

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

| Area | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| **API calls** | `http` package with 15s timeout, `ServerException` / `NetworkException` classification |
| **Error handling** | Repository layer maps technical exceptions → user-friendly `Failure` messages. No raw exceptions leak to the UI |
| **Typed models** | `UserModel.fromJson()` with null-safe defaults. Zero `Map<String, dynamic>` in the UI layer |
| **Debounce** | ~500ms debounce on `SubmitPace` to prevent rapid-fire POST requests |
| **Navigation** | Horizontal `PageView` with swipe transitions + shared animated top indicator |
| **State preservation** | `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` keeps all inputs/search/data alive across swipes |
| **Custom painting** | `GlowSliderThumbShape` + `CustomSliderTrackShape` for the piecewise glowing slider |
| **Lint rules** | Strict `analysis_options.yaml` with `prefer_const_constructors`, `prefer_final_locals`, etc. |

## 🔄 What I'd Do Differently With More Time

- **Cubit instead of BLoC** — for screens like these, `Cubit` is more concise and sufficient. Full BLoC with events is overkill when there are no complex event-to-event transformations
- **Freezed + build_runner instead of Equatable** — auto-generated `copyWith`, `==`, `toString`, sealed unions, and JSON serialization out of the box. Less boilerplate, fewer human errors
- **GetIt for dependency injection** — replace manual DI wiring in `main.dart` with `GetIt` + `Injectable` for a scalable, testable service locator
- **GoRouter instead of Navigator** — declarative routing with deep linking support, typed route parameters, and better navigation state management
- **Dio instead of http** — built-in interceptors, request cancellation, automatic retries, and `FormData` support. Much more flexible for production apps
- **Public widget classes instead of private build methods** — extract `_buildUserCard()`, `_buildSearchBar()`, `_buildPickerColumn()` etc. into separate public widget files. This improves reusability, testability, and keeps files under 200–300 lines
- **Tests** — unit tests for BLoCs with `bloc_test`, repository tests with `mocktail`, widget tests for key UI flows
